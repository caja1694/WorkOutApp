1. You Don't Prioritize The Right Exercises At The Beginning Of Your Workout
You walk into the gym and start your workout by doing every biceps curl variation you know, before you even think about pulling exercises for your back. 
Then, you wonder why your back muscles are lagging behind.

How To Fix It
Prioritize compound movements at the beginning of your workout. Compound movements like chin-ups, presses, rows, squats, 
and deadlifts are your bread and butter exercises, the ones that bring you the most bang for your buck. They engage several muscles at a time, 
increasing the metabolic demand made by your workout and stimulating more overall growth.

The question of which compound exercise to perform first is easy to answer: Prioritize the exercise you want to get strongest in. For instance, 
if you have both a barbell bench press and a barbell shoulder press on your training menu and you're trying to develop your delts, you would start with shoulder presses.",
